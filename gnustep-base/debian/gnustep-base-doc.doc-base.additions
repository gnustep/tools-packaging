Title: GNUstep Base Additions API Reference
Author: Richard Frith-Macdonald
Abstract: The GNUstep base additions package comes with the
 GNUstep base package, and provides additional non-standard classes
 and additio nal features for standard classes. It is also intended to
 be built standalone for use on systems where the GNUstep base is not
 installed, but where an alternative Foundation is available.
